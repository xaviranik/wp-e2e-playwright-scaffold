on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Cancels all previous workflow runs for pull requests that have not completed.
concurrency:
    # The concurrency group contains the workflow name and the branch name for pull requests
    # or the commit hash for any other events.

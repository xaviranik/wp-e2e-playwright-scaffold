# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# Cancels all previous workflow runs for pull requests that have not completed.
concurrency:
  # The concurrency group contains the workflow name and the branch name for pull requests
  # or the commit hash for any other events.
